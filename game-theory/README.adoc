== Introduction

In evolutionary game theory, players update their strategies in time according
to their expected payoff in one-on-one competition with a population of
competitors. In the simplest case, each competitor competes with every other.
However, this need not be the case. Instead, each competitor might have a
neighborhood competitors with whom they play their game. We can envision this
graphically as a graph whose nodes are agents and whose edges represent agents
who are in competition with one another. I am going to call this graph the
_playground_.

The questions we wish to address are: if an external observer can only see the
strategies of the agents over time, can they

. infer the underlying playground?
. infer the game that the agents are playing?
