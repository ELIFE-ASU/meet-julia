= A Simple N-Body Simulation
:source-highlighter: prettify
:stem: latexmath

== Introduction

This example compares naive implementations of an stem:[N]-body problem. We use
a simple Euler integrator method to evolve the position of stem:[N] object
interacting gravitationally.

== Methods

Each program reads the mass, position and velocity of some number of bodies from
a JSON file. The provided data file includes 6 bodies:
[source,json]
----
include::nbody.json[]
----
We compute the total energy of the system after reading in the initial states.
The state of the system is then advanced in time steps of stem:[0.01~days]. The
energy of the system is then recalculated.

== Results

The following results were obtained on an AWS t2.medium instance.
