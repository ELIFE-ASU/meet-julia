Hi, my name is Julia. I can do everything that Python can do, more even, and I
actually have a personality. I'm a bit jovial in fact.

My favorite animal is the elusive https://github.com/octocat[octocat].
Unfortunately, Unicode hasn't gotten with the times and added an octocat glyph,
so I'll have to improvize a bit:

julia> 🐙🐱() = println("meow?")
julia> 🐙🐱()
meow?

Enough with the silliness. Start digging into the various directories for
examples of how I do what I do, and comparisons of my work to the likes of C,
{cpp}, Python and R.

Hopefully, by the end of this, you will be proselyte worshiping at the alter of
Julia.
