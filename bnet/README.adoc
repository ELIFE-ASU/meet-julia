= Boolean Network Attractors
:source-highlighter: prettify
:stem: latexmath

== Introduction

A common problem in our group is to determin the attractor cycles of a given
Boolean network. This functionality is currently implemented in `Neet`, but we
reimplement it here in {cpp}, Python and Julia for comparison's sake.

== Methods

We constructed a weight-threshold Boolean network in each language, and proceed
to compute the attractor cycles. This process consists of three basic steps:

. Construct the boolean network
. Compute all state transitions
. Traverse the state transition graph (or an equivalent representation) to
identify the attractor cycles.

== Results

The following results were obtained on an AWS t2.medium instance.

Notice that Julia is faster than C++ in the second invocation! This will hold
for every subsequent invocation of `attractors`.
